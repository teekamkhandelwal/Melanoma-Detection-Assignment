# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment

> The purpose of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow. The model aims to accurately classify dermoscopic images of skin lesions as either Melanoma or Non-Melanoma. This classification can assist in early precautions and timely intervention.

## General Information
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma

Dermatofibroma

Melanoma

Nevus

Pigmented benign keratosis

Seborrheic keratosis

Squamous cell carcinoma

Vascular lesion

**Observation/Result-**
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
- As the accuracy of the model increases, the loss decreases
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
